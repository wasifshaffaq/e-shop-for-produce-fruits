# e-shop-for-produce-fruits
integration of html, css, bootstrap, react, js, node... into making a web app
my goal will be to create a platform where customers can browse the catalog to see out of the diversity of produce fruits which one would they like to buy and check out with.
This web app will tackle with real time food/fruit prices to get the lastest and best discount on your purchases 
the target is to provide the optimal and smooth experience for the user along with afforable prices keeping in mind to balance out the revenue and and hosting that goes with it
